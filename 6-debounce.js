// Write a function that debounces another function. Debouncing limits how often a function can run; it only allows a function to run if it hasnâ€™t been called in the last delay milliseconds.
// Example Usage: If called multiple times, the debounced function should only execute once after delay milliseconds of no calls.
// Function Signature: function debounce(func, delay) { /* your code */ }
